Common CMake code for Rock libraries
====================================
This package contains the common [Rock](http://rock-robotics.org)
[CMake macros](http://rock-robotics.org/documentation/packages/cmake_macros.html).
A standard C++ library skeleton using these macros can be generated in Rock
[using the rock-create-lib](http://rock-robotics.org/documentation/tutorials/100_basics_create_library.html) tool.

This package is automatically installed when using Rock's autoproj tool. However,
if you wish to install a Rock library without autoproj,
[follow these instructions](http://rock-robotics.org/documentation/packages/outside_of_rock.html)

In addition, this package defines / fixes some standard CMake Find scripts, as well
as ships additional ones that are commonly used in Rock.
